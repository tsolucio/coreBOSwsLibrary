**core Business Operating System Webservice Development Libraries**

You can find additional information on the usage of the libraries in the [coreBOS documentation wiki](http://corebos.org/documentation) and tests and examples in the [coreBOS Webservice Development tool](https://github.com/tsolucio/coreBOSwsDevelopment).

The *coreBOS* team is actively maintaining the PHP and Javascript versions of the library.

David Fernández (kapsule) is maintaining the python and .NET (csharp) versions at [kapsule/coreBOSwsLibrary](https://github.com/kapsule/coreBOSwsLibrary) while they are being kept in sync here for easy access. *Thank you* David

The java library is not being maintained. Any help is appreciated.

These libraries have been built using several other open source libraries whose details are given below:
